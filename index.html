Hi Hunny Bun! <b><u>I love you so so much!</u></b> These past few months have truly been such a blessing and it has everything to do with you being in my life. God really knew what He was doing by bringing us together and I am eternally grateful to Him doing that! This really really smart girl I know likes to say "God is so cool for that!!" (<i>She's you btw <3</i>) I totally forget I semi learned how to very elementarily code in High School and decided ya know what, this would be a very fun way for you to try to guess was your gifts are for Christmas! Sooooo each photo of the gifts below will actually be a link leading you to a hint for what your next gift will be! Thought this would just be a cute lil of adding even more fun to the gift exchange for us <3 (Btw this is how in love you ya got me to be, I went and straight up coded a whole website for you lol, that's so silly, it's because <b>I just love you so much!!!</b>)
